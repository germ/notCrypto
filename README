notCrypto: Encryption that can easily be broken but is good enough
-=-=-=-=-

Why: 	
	Because I wanted to make something for encrypting my journals
	just enough to fool any non programmers that take a look at it.

	The algo is documented in the journal itself defeating its 
	purpose. I plan on coming back to the journal in the future
	and reimplmenting the algorithims from scratch.

	Chances are github or my data will be long gone by then.

This is stupid, why not use proper crypto?:
	Because some days you just want a little bit of privacy and 
	something to distract you. This is version1. As time goes on
	and I get more ideas I will design and document them.

	A note on the RNG: I needed something small that I could throw
	into a small journal, not something cryptographicly secure.


On Testing:
	There are some tests in here that are really crap. I've never
	been a big fan of tests but I did come to appriciate them  a
	little more with this and will use them properly in the future

	The tests are mostly there to allow me to quickly inspect some
	facet of my code.

tldr: Breakups suck.
